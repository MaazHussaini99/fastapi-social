# Fastapi Social Application

## My first proper API application for a complete social media platform

It is an api built using python while utilizing FastAPI to implement Rest framework. 
This api is built to connect frontend of a social application to the database which is setup using PostgreSQL.

# Information to be added for cloning and description.

## Installation

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install fastapi

---> 100%
```

</div>

You will also need an ASGI server, for production such as <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pgjones/hypercorn" class="external-link" target="_blank">Hypercorn</a>.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

### Run it

Run the server with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uvicorn main:app --reload

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
